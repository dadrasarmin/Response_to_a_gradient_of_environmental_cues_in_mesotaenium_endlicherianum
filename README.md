### Sequences used as inputs
If we used any publicly available sequence for an analysis, we gathered them from this sources (sorted by the priorities):
1. Phytozome
2. The supplamentary files of the paper which sequenced or annotated a genome
3. Any website mentioned on the paper which sequenced or annotated a genome

To save space, we just put a file containing the name of files (organisms) which were used for each genome re-annotation step.
All RNAseq reads have been uploaded to NCBI SRA and can be accessed under Bioproject PRJNA832564 and SRA accessions SRR18936040 to SRR18936170.
