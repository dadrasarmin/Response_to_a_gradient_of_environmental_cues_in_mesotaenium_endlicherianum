  # max_regression: if the ORF lacks a valid start site, this percentage indicates how far
  # along the sequence Mikado should look for a good start site. Eg. with
  # a value of 0.1, on a 300bp sequence with an open ORF Mikado would look
  # for an alternative in-frame start codon in the first 30 bps (10% of
  # the cDNA).
  max_regression: 0.2
  # start_adjustment: Boolean switch. If set to true (default), if an ORF is truncated at
  # the 5' Mikado will look for internal start codons. See
  # 'max_regression'.
